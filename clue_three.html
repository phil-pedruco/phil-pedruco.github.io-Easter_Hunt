        <p>On to 7-11, everyones favorite Slurpee destination. There you'll need to get a pack of playing cards - that's what (some of) the $10 was for. </p>

        <p>You'll need to turn right on to Rothwell Street and walk to St Leonards Road. Number 28 St Leonards Road look like an old Victorian Terrace, when was it built?</p>
        <p>Back towards the railway line and to the corner of St Leonards Road and The Crescent, and if I wanted to go to the Union Road shop, how far would that be?</p>
        <p>Turn left on The Crescent and head north towards Maribyrong Road, along the way there's a plantation, but whose?</p>
        <p>The Victorians like to name their house, what is 4 The Parade called?</p>  
        <p>Now take the No Through Road and you won't fail to notice the some Graffiti. Who is this Street Artist?</p>
        <p>Take a right on to Maribyrnong Road and might see a slogan on the bridge, let us know what it is? Bonus Eggs if you can let us what it means?</p>
        <p>Sometimes I wonder if my children actually passed kindergarten, can you find me a one to send them back to? What's it name?</p>
        <p>The power line to 9 Maribyrnong Road has some interesting attached to it, what is it?</p>
        <p>Finally your destination is in sight, you'll just need the code to get to the next set of clues. What's the name of a godly name who has a shop you can see? Get this right and you'll clean up.</p>
